Tweaking Aura cost for Repair on Thaumium Grafters and other balance.
Turns out I can't get the version crap to work properly. More fixes.

Fixed bug with Thaumium Grafter not being enchantable.

1.3.0c
Discovered a function call that will crash dedicated servers. If you are running ThuamicBees on a server, please update to this revision.

Fixed the issue with certain items appearing twice in Creative Mode tabs.

1.3.0a
Some bug fixes, including uncommenting some mutation-related code, research tweaking.
Added the last bee for a long while, probably. Good luck getting it.

Common TB crashes stemming from Forestry issues should now be reported a little better, especially the backpack registration & item texture file related things. Errors should appear in your log, so make sure you read the log before you report the error here. It could be something silly on your end that is causing the crash.

1.3.0
3 new species of bee: Vis, Pure, and Flux! Each requires an aura node nearby, and may have some side-effects...
New Thaumcraft research! Open up your Thaumanomicon to see it.
New Apiary Frames! They run off magic, confers bees with bonuses, and may have an impact outside of your apiary...

1.2.705B - Replaced 1.2.705
Fixed issue with bad Mutation class, allowing pure bees to turn into any bee that involves them in a mutation.
Also ACTUALLY fixed issue with Extra Bees loading after ThaumicBees on *nix-based systems.

1.2.705
*Stealth update: Fixed an issue with TB loading before Extra Bees, resulting in some Null Pointers getting passed and choked on. If you get this issue, please re-download 1.2.705. No other changes were made in this version.

*8 new species of bees, including "Praecantatio", which, like the other Elemental bees, may contain Vis shards in its propolis. Some of the new species may also have extra evil involved, so be ready for anything.
*Extra integration with Extra Bees! Mutations for some of the new bees. If Extra Bees is present, their mutations will require EB species rather than the base Forestry species.
*Changed the "Charmed" mutation to avoid conflicting with Extra Bees. (Binnie already had one there, so mine got moved.)
*New bee branch, similar to Extra Bees's mob spawning bees.
*One new bee from a new branch, the rest of which will come once Azanor releases the Thaumcraft API.

1.1.702-67 - Replaced 1.1.702-62
Additional Magic Capsules, featuring ExtraBees liquids, and RailCraft Creosote & Steam. (Yes, steam capsules. It's magic. That's how. :P)
Tagged additional Forestry items with Thaumcraft aspects.

1.1.702-62
Added Magic Capsules!
Compatible with BuildCraft and Forestry liquids, they function almost the same way as refactory capsules, except that they can store 2 buckets' worth of liquid. As such, you cannot right-click with them to scoop up water or lava, but you can use them in bottlers, carpenters, Railcraft's Iron Tanks, Thermal Expansion's liquid transposers, and other things that support the Forge Liquid Dictionary. They can be useful for storing larger amounts of liquids in chests and things. I am also able to add other liquids to them in the future, and liquids from mods that are not present will not appear in the Creative inventory or the NEI listings.

1.0.701-56
Update to Forestry 1.7.0.1/1.7.0.2

Added all kinds of backpack integration for Thaumcraft, including a new Thaumaturge's Backpack and Woven variety. These will suck up shards, Thaumcraft resources such as quicksilver, amber, zombie brains, research fragments and other goodies. Other TC items such as marker blocks, warded stone, candles, logs, leaves and plants also can fall into Forestry's default backpacks as appropriate. (I may have missed some other obvious items.)

1.0.70-53
Update to Forestry 1.7.0.0

1.0.0-50
-Added Thaumcraft aspects to some Forestry items, notably combs and bees. (Finally, something to use those extra drones for!)

-Added carpenter recipe for candles using magic wax. Same patterns as with beeswax.

1.0.0-48
-Support for Forestry 1.6.5.5+
-Extra alles for bee mutations!
-Thaumcraft aspects associated with some Forestry items!

1.0.0-35
